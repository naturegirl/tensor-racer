contains first round of training dataset.
Was taken with tilted camera angle on ad-hoc tape track that I laid out at home.

There are 3 labels: straight, left and right, and the images in the corresponding folders.
Furthermore the images are indexed based on the driving sequence.
Images are in jpg format, with 100x100 resolution.
